# Journey from the Stars
by Camilo Pareja

## About
Use this song to relax, add it to your study music playlist, get re-energized by it, and more!

You'll feel like you're travelling to the stars, landing, and enjoying the ambiance. 

## Inspiration
Thank you to Dr. Sarah Harmon for sharing knowledge about using Sonic Pi and how to create calming music.

Thank you to YouTuber Levi Niha for encouraging me to jump into Sonic Pi code and experiment. His rhythms are on point!

## Elements
The song uses various elements such as:
  - a tempo that slows gradually from start to finish at key moments
  - low BPM (larghetto)
  - soft space sounds
  - dreamy chords
  - inverted chords
  - slow parts for focus and calm
  - upbeat moments for energy and rejuvination
